# ProjectOrganizerPage
Get some organization in all your solutions, test projects, your git repositories and set all the info in your start page instead of figuring it out yourself.

If you are like me you have a lot of solutions you are working on. If I find a bug in a project I fix it myself. Sometimes you need to test it out in a test project of some sort. Or you have to do maintenance on different projects and where did you set them again. It can be confusing and a mess.

With this extension we have a new start page for Visual Studio that gives a proper overview of all your projects and states.

Status: Lots of work!!!
